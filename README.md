## About me

<div>
  <p>I am a 24-year-old self-taught developer who is always looking for <b>new opportunities and projects to contribute to.</b></p>
  <p>I am mainly interested in building projects that aim to have a social impact. To me, technology is a practical tool for people's everyday challenges, while also being a field that allows creativity and innovation.  <b>Backend technologies and databases</b> are my main interests, and I have built a few projects where I focused heavily on those sides of the application</p>

- [My most exciting project so far](https://github.com/paezdavid/calles-py) is a website on which users can **upload pictures and locations** of streets that need maintenance in Paraguay. This project aims to make visible the problems that the streets of my country have. Built with Express, Tailwind, Supabase, and MongoDB.

- [My second most interesting project](https://github.com/paezdavid/chessapi) is a RESTful API for the Lichess' chess puzzles database. Built with Express and MongoDB.

- Lately, I have been working on improving existing web platforms. [Here's a project](https://github.com/paezdavid/buscador-de-catalogo) based on a virtual library on which I focused on improving its search engine and UX/UI. 
  
- I've also built some projects about **crawling and aggregation**, as seen in [this news aggregator project](https://github.com/paezdavid/agregador-noticias). Built with Flask.

- This year, I worked as a mentor in three [Penguin Academy's](https://github.com/penguin-academy) **Python bootcamps**. On one of those hackathons, the final project for me and my team was a [REST API to centralize data from Paraguay's prison system](https://github.com/paezdavid/hackathon-abril-penguin).

- I love **languages** and **cybersecurity**. A few months ago, I made an independent [translation for a document about the basics of cybersecurity](https://github.com/paezdavid/ciberseguridad-essentials).

- A couple of other projects I have under my belt are a [DOI metadata extraction tool](https://github.com/paezdavid/doi-metadata), a repo with some [Leetcode challenges](https://github.com/paezdavid/leetcode-challenges) I have been solving, a website to [check the weather](https://github.com/paezdavid/weather-website) and some [static websites](https://github.com/paezdavid/bookmark-landing-page) built with plain HTML and CSS. 

#### I like to work with Javascript, Node.js, Python, Flask, FastAPI, MongoDB, SQL, HTML, and CSS.
