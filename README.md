## About me

<div>
  <p>I am a 23-year-old developer looking for his <b>first job in the tech industry.</b></p>
  <p>I am mainly interested in <b>backend technologies and databases</b>, and I have built a few projects where I focused heavily on the backend of the application</p>

</div>
  
- [My most exciting project so far](https://github.com/paezdavid/calles-py) is a website on which users can **upload pictures and locations** of streets that need maintenance in Paraguay. The aim of this project is to make visible the urbanization problems that my country has.

- [My second most interesting project](https://github.com/paezdavid/chess-puzzles-pdf) is a website on which you can **filter puzzles from the Lichess database** and put them in a **PDF** document.
  
- Lately, and only for educational purposes, I've also been learning about **crawling and aggregation**, as seen in [this news aggregator project](https://github.com/paezdavid/agregador-noticias).

- This year, I was also a participant in [Penguin Academy's](https://github.com/penguin-academy) **Python bootcamp**. The final project for me and my team was a [web application to geolocate artisans in Paraguay](https://github.com/paezdavid/hackathon2).

- I am majoring in English with a focus on translation EN/ES. Combining my studies with my interest in **cybersecurity**, I've done an independent [translation for a document about the basics of cybersecurity](https://github.com/paezdavid/ciberseguridad-essentials).

- A couple of other projects I have under my belt are a website to [check the weather](https://github.com/paezdavid/weather-website) and some [static websites](https://github.com/paezdavid/bookmark-landing-page) built with plain HTML and CSS. 

#### I like to work with Javascript, Node.js, Python, MongoDB, HTML, and CSS. 
#### I am currently learning about PostgreSQL, and just general computer science concepts.
